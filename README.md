Tasks for Professional Software Developers
As part of Mission Ready's Github Education offering, you get Free Microsoft Azure credits.  Please make sure you use the free credits for the Missions.  We cannot reimburse expenses you incur on Azure.

Task 1. Prototype to Showcase AI Solution
Build an application to find Similar Cars

The digital team at Turners would like to prototype a solution that allows a user to upload the picture of a car, and then find a similar car in their stock to recommend to customer. Build an application (either runs on your laptop or on the cloud) that can recognise motor vehicles (even better if it recognises certain types of vehicles, e.g. sedan vs hatchback) using a cloud-based AI service on Microsoft Azure. You can copy code from tutorials you find online, but make sure you read through the code so that you understand the code.

The reviewers are supposed to add comments within GitHub at relevant lines of code.
